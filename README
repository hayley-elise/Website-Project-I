# Website-Project-I
The first website project in my Software Development class (Fall 2020)
Goal was to demonstrate my familiarity with the fundamentals of HTML and CSS by developing a
website around a coherent theme of my choosing.

Required to show in the website the following:
  • Navigation, at least 3 pages, where each links to the others
  • Specifying styles (show you can specify attributes in all three ways):
      o in a .css style file
      o embedded in the head section of an .html file
      o inline with an element
  • use of div & span with classes & ids in the application of styling attributes to both text &
    images (e.g. font size, weight, color, boxes, borders, margins, padding, etc.)
  • use of web fonts
  • a variety of layouts & display modes (at least three)
      o table
      o floats
      o flex
      o boxes
      o columns
      o galleries
      o other
